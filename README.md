<h3>HomeCoo</h3>
We noticed that there tends to be families all over the US that cook more than what they eat.
This application modeled selling the extra food that families tend cook.
The buyer could go into this app and see what the families around his commute would be cookig for the day ahead of time. After choosing
desired meal, they would request one for them. Ether for pick-up to to eat with the family, just like back at home. 
The cook is able to list their meals for the whole week and set the prices at any time of the day.
This application was developed at SD Hacks at UC San Diego.
