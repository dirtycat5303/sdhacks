We noticed that there are families all over the US that cook more than what they eat.</br>This application modeled selling the extra food that families cook.</br>The buyer could go into this app and see what the families around his commute would be cookig for the day ahead of time. </br>After choosing desired meal, they would request one for them. Ether for pick-up to to eat with the family, just like back at home.</br>The cook is able to list their meals for the whole week and set the prices at any time of the day.</br>
This application was developed at SD Hacks at UC San Diego.
